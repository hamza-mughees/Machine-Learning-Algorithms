# Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning is an inovating, fascinating, exciting branch of computer science. This repository will contain implementations of various machine learning and data science algorithms, from scratch.

Machine learning is a subject that isn't touched until final year in Trinity College. However, I find this area way too fascinating to be able to wait until then. Therefore, I have recently started doing a [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) course on this topic and I'm absolutely hooked.
